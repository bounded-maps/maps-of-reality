**Maps Of Reality** is a collaborative, open-source attempt to compress the most important knowledge about reality, humans, and living - while explicitly acknowledging that all models are incomplete.

This project focuses on **high signal-to-noise understanding**, not breadth, ideology, or comfort.

## Core Principles
- **Relevance Principle**
  A topic belongs in this project only if it meaningfully improves how most humans understand themselves, others, or the systems they live in.

- **Models, not truths**  
  All content is treated as a map of reality, never reality itself.

- **First principles over opinion**  
  Claims should be grounded in biology, mathematics, empirical evidence, or clearly stated reasoning.

- **Compression over completeness**  
  The goal is to remove confusion, not accumulate information.

- **Explicit limits**  
  Every model has boundaries. Where something breaks is as important as where it works.

- **Humans are constrained systems**  
  Cognition, belief, morality, and behavior are shaped by evolution, incentives, and finite resources.

## What This Is (refinement needed)

- A shared map of high-impact ideas about humans and reality  
- A place to document core models, constraints, and tradeoffs  
- An evolving, versioned knowledge base  
- Open to disagreement, revision, and refactoring  

---

## What This Is Not (refinement needed)

- Not a self-help guide
- Not a spiritual or religious framework  
- Not political ideology  
- Not consensus truth  
- Not complete or final  

---

## Scope

Topics include (but are not limited to):

- Limits of formal systems (Gödel, game theory, democracy)
- Human cognition and intelligence (local vs global processing, creativity, hallucination)
- Biology and evolution (nutrition, fasting, sunlight, health constraints)
- Belief systems (religion, authority, confidence, meaning)
- Incentives, power, and coordination failures
- Living under constraints (time, energy, tradeoffs)

## How to Read

Each file aims to answer:
> “What does this change about how a human understands the world or acts within it?”

If it doesn’t meaningfully reduce confusion, it doesn’t belong.

## Contributing

Thoughtful contributions are welcome.

Before contributing, please read:
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` (todo)

Disagreement is expected. Ideology is not.

## Status

Early-stage. Structure is intentionally simple.
The quality bar is high by design.
