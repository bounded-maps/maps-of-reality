**Maps Of Reality** is a collaborative, open-source attempt to compress the most important knowledge about reality, humans, and living - while explicitly acknowledging that all models are incomplete.

This project focuses on **high signal-to-noise understanding**, not breadth, ideology, or comfort.

## Core Principles
- **Relevance Principle**
  A topic belongs in this project only if it meaningfully improves how most humans understand themselves, others, or the systems they live in.

- **Models, not truths**  
  All content is treated as a map of reality, never reality itself.

- **First principles over opinion**  
  Claims should be grounded in biology, mathematics, empirical evidence, or clearly stated reasoning.

- **Compression over completeness**  
  The goal is to remove confusion, not accumulate information.

- **Explicit limits**  
  Every model has boundaries. Where something breaks is as important as where it works.
