## What This Is (refinement needed)

- A shared map of high-impact ideas about humans and reality  
- A place to document core models, constraints, and tradeoffs  
- An evolving, versioned knowledge base  
- Open to disagreement, revision, and refactoring  

---

## What This Is Not (refinement needed)

- Not a self-help guide
- Not a spiritual or religious framework  
- Not political ideology  
- Not consensus truth  
- Not complete or final

## Scope

Topics include (but are not limited to):

- Limits of formal systems (Gödel, game theory, democracy)
- Human cognition and intelligence (local vs global processing, creativity, hallucination)
- Biology and evolution (nutrition, fasting, sunlight, health constraints)
- Belief systems (religion, authority, confidence, meaning)
- Incentives, power, and coordination failures
- Living under constraints (time, energy, tradeoffs)

## How to Read
