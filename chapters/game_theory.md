# Life and Game Theory

If you're unfamiliar with game theory, I recommend starting with this introduction: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mScpHTIi-kM

## The Optimal Strategy

Brutally simplifying things: if we view life as a game, the optimal strategy appears to be tit-for-tat from the iterated Prisoner's Dilemma.

This strategy follows four simple rules:
1. Be nice - start with cooperation (never defect first)
2. Be cooperative - default to collaborative behavior
3. Retaliate when wronged - immediately respond to defection by defecting once
4. Practice careful forgiveness - return to cooperation after retaliating, breaking cycles without becoming exploitable

I believe evolution may have favored humans who internalize tit-for-tat principles because they represent winning strategies for social survival. Without cooperation, proportional retaliation, and forgiveness, early human communication and socialization would have been difficult.

## Questions This Can Answer

**Life is not as simple as a simple PvP game or iterated Prisoner's Dilemma**

Yes, but I believe we can frame the environment to apply these principles or at least gain interpretation from this perspective. For example: Why cooperate in one-on-one situations? Because they positively reinforce the whole group to cooperate. "Laws" should fill the missing gaps, for example in retaliation (as punishment).

**Why unlawful acts like stealing or assault are bad**

In this case, treat the victims as the other players. Even though they may or may not retaliate, this will encourage violation of the first principle. As a society, we need to encourage people to follow these principles to maximize each person's gains.

**Do defectors have an optimal strategy in a tightly knit group with good people?**

First, laws exist to enforce these principles. For severe crimes or high-level defections, punishments make defection less favorable. What about minor crimes? See below.

**Even minor infractions like littering**

It's obvious why littering is bad, but it still happens. One way of viewing this is one versus society (similar to what's explained above—littering encourages society to do the same, which will eventually negatively affect you).

**What about pirating games?**

If you can afford it, then you should purchase, rewarding a player for being nice (making good contributions to society). However, in rare cases when you genuinely cannot afford it, you can positively influence it by spreading the game's popularity (which would not be possible without pirating). A good quote I saw on X recently: "Culture shouldn't exist only for those who can afford it" (see footnotes for full quote and source).

- **Full Quote** (source: https://x.com/HakitaDev/status/1797245014268891236):

  "As creator of said game: You should support indies if you can, but culture shouldn't exist only for those who can afford it. ULTRAKILL wouldn't exist if I hadn't had easy access to movies, music and games growing up.

  If you don't have money, you can support via word of mouth."

- **Some of my simplified math for crimes, probabilities, and the gains**

  Calculating probabilities:
  1. You are not punished - prob: x, gain: a
  2. You are punished - prob: (1-x), gain: -b

  Ideally, expected gain should be less than 0:
  
  xa + (1-x)(-b) < 0
  
  b/a > x/(1-x)

  Basically, there should be stronger punishment than the odds of getting punished (Related Field: Deterrence Theory). It can't be this simple though, it doesnt make sense to give a strong punishment to minor offense. And above all, it's hard to quantify a and b, there could be people say pickpocketers willing to trade thier time in prison for probable gain. But the laws and probabilities make high-severity crimes less favorable.
